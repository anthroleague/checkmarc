checkmarc
=========

checkmarc is a django app that lets you build validation reports for batches of MARC records. Just create a report, add some checks for it to run, and then give it a marc file to validate. It'll spit out  list of records probably need to be inspected along with an indication of which check(s)'s criteria were met.
